# Higher Nether Max Build Height Datapack

This is a very simple, [one-file](https://github.com/anonymous123-code/higher-nether-max-build-height-datapack/blob/main/data/minecraft/dimension_type/the_nether.json) data pack created with [misode.github.io](https://misode.github.io/).

It does two main things:

- Changes the maximum build height in the nether to 320 blocks. (+64)
- Changes the maximum chorus fruit and nether portal generation height to 192. (+64) This means you can chorus fruit teleport to the nether roof and portals will be generated over the nether roof in worlds where the nether world gen is not changed to be higher

It is tested to work with the current version of [Incendium](https://modrinth.com/mod/incendium) (1.20.1 v5.3.1)
